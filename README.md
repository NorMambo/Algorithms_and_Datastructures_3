## TASKS:

1) Quadratic probing hash table implementation
2) Testing the quadratic probing hash table
3) Insertion sort implementation
4) Heapsort implementation
5) Quicksort (3 variants: pure, combined with insertion sort, combined with heapsort) implementation
6) Mergesort iterative and recursive implementation
7) Shellsort (with different gap sequences) implementation

## NOTES:

I use JDK 21

GUIDE:

1) All tasks with sorting algorithms have a main function to test the algorithm
inside the sorting algorithm class. So does the Quadratic Probing Hash Table.

2) The classes called Test are used to run the tests for the tasks that need a report.

3) SupportClasses contains functions classes like Timer, InfoList and CSVreaderWriter,
which are only used in the Test classes to time the execution and write the execution times
to files.
